# Math-4-Kids-Web-App
Math 4 Kids is a web application for grade school children to practice their math skills. I decided to create this application to use within our homeschool currirulum for my daughter to practice and develop proficiency in solving addition/subtraction problems.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

The original JavaScript resulted in the subtraction equations to have a negative solution and based on the grade level of our website visitors, I needed to rewrite the code to ensure all subtraction solutions are positive integers.

In the near future, I have plans to add more features to the application to cater to younger aged children with an option to add counters for those who need visuals to solve. 

## Lessons Learned:

While building this website, I learned how to utilize the Math.floor and Math.random function to generate random numbers and how to swap integers using a temporary variable.
